//You are given two strings s and t consisting of only lowercase English letters.

//Return the minimum number of characters that need to be appended to the end of s so that t becomes a subsequence of s.

//A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.
